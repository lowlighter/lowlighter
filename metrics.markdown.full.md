# 📒 Markdown template example

This is a markdown template example which explain the basic usage of this template.

See [rendering of this file here](https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/metrics.markdown.full.md).

## 🈂️ Templating syntax:

* Regular EJS syntax is supported
* `{{` and `}}` will be interpolated as EJS brackets (syntaxic sugar)
  * `` can be used as control statements
* Use [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io/) with `config.output=json` to see available data
  * You can also use `config_output: json` in GitHub Actions and/or inspect [metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics) code to get available data too
* Same formatting helpers available in templates can be used too

```markdown
I joined GitHub on `20/10/2016`.
I contributed to `15` repositories and made `1337` commits.
```

## 🧩 Markdown plugins

Most of plugins from SVG templates can be reused directly by including image source in markdown, but some have them have their own **markdown** version which includes hyperlinks.
